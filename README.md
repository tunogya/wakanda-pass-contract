# Geohash

Geohash is a virtual land project made by Wakanda Labs.

At the beginning of the project, the total circulation was only 32 NFTs, and their geohash were 32 characters in the geohash algorithm (0-9, plus 22 letters except a, i, l, o). Each NFT can continue to be divided into 32 sub-NFTs, reciprocating continuously. We aim to give everyone in the world an opportunity to become a member.
